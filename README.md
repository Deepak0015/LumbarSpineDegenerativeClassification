Project Abstract:

Low back pain is a prevalent and disabling condition affecting millions worldwide, often resulting from egenerative spine conditions. This project aims to advance the diagnosis and classification of lumbar spine degenerative disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the project focuses on five key conditions: Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing, Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing, Left Subarticular Stenosis, Right Subarticular Stenosis, and Spinal Canal Stenosis. Each condition is assessed across five intervertebral disc levels (L1/L2 to L5/S1), with severity classified into Normal/Mild, Moderate, or Severe categorie
